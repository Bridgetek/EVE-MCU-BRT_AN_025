# EVE-MCU-BRT_AN_025-Example-Pico
Example code for Application Note BRT_AN_025 for the Raspberry Pi Pico Board

Refer to the Bridgetek Application Note document BRT_AN_025 for details on the example code.

To build use CMake. Firstly initialise the build directory into a directory called `build`. This only needs to be done once.

```
$ cmake -B build -S .
```

Next, build the code.

```
$ cmake --build build
```

The build will end with the following messages. Places where compilation steps are not shown are marked in the output.

```

There will be the following files in the `build` directory:

```
$ ls build/
CMakeCache.txt  Makefile             elf2uf2    libeve_example.a  pico-sdk  pico.dis  pico.elf.map  pico.uf2
CMakeFiles      cmake_install.cmake  generated  libeve_library.a  pico.bin  pico.elf  pico.hex
```

To run the code on the Pico, power-up the pico with the BOOTSEL button depressed. It will instantiate a removable drive. Now copy the file `pico.uf2` to the removable drive.
