 *      The timeout value here must be adjusted for the host system SPI clock speed.
 *      The SPI clock speed is set in the Platform_Init(void) function for a port.
 *      Values here match the default values set in the ports.
 *      At 1 MHz SPI bus the timeout is approximately 8 clock cycles (1 byte).
 *      At 20 MHz SPI bus the timeout is approximately 140 clock cycles (17.5 bytes).
 *      At 25 MHz SPI bus the timeout is approximately 175 clock cycles (24 bytes).
